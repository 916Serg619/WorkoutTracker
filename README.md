# WorkoutTracker

Create an application in which the user can track and store various information in relation to their past, or current workout routine

## Technology Used

Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose, and Heroku were ustilized for this assignment. Majority of the front end and functionality were provided, I created the models, routes, and server.

## Installation

npm install before running project.

## Challenges

Most of my challenges were small in scale, but ultimately have been hindering me from progressing like I want to. I focus too much on syntax, and I get easily distracted with educating myself on related technologies that I will probably not use. This assignment has made me realize what it actually means to be a full-stack web developer.
